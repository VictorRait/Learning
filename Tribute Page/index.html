            <h3>Declaration of Human Rights</h3>
            <p>After centuries of religious persecution, injustice and disregard for human rights, the acceptance of
                human rights enshrined in law is one of the great achievements of modern history. Some of the earliest
                declarations can be seen in the US constitution, drafted by Thomas Jefferson.</p>

            <blockquote>“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all
                men are created equal, that they
                are endowed
                by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of
                Happiness.”

                – US Declaration of Human Rights, July 4, 1776</blockquote>

                human rights enshrined in law is one of the great achievements of modern history. Some of the earliest

            <h3>The First Flight</h3>
            <p>The Wright brothers finally achieved man's historic quest to fly. The short flight in 1903 revolutionised
                air travel in the twentieth century and remains one of the great technical achievements.</p>

            <h3>Vaccines</h3>
            <p>For many centuries, the life expectancy of man was very low. Life was hard, short and painful. The great
                advances of medical science in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have allowed people in many
                developed countries to have a much greater life expectancy. Some of the most important discoveries
                included the first vaccines developed by Edward Jenner (small Pox) Louis Pasteur (Rabies). The creation
                of vaccines and widespread vaccination programmes have led to the decline (and in some cases) extinction
                of dangerous diseases, such as polio, TB, smallpox and others.</p>

            <h3>Man on the Moon</h3>
            <p>It was a great scientific achievement to put man in space and then land on the surface of the moon. It
                shows that the horizons of man are not limited to this physical earth.</p>
